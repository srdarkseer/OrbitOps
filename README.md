# OrbitOps - Multi-Agent Cloud Orchestrator

OrbitOps is an AI-powered DevOps automation system that uses multiple LLM agents to intelligently manage cloud infrastructure across AWS and Azure without requiring traditional scripts.

## Vision

"Agent-as-DevOps" - A revolutionary approach where specialized AI agents collaborate to handle the entire cloud management lifecycle, from analysis to implementation to monitoring.

## Architecture

The system consists of 7 specialized agents working in coordination:

1. **Agent 1: Architecture Reader** - Reads and understands your cloud architecture
2. **Agent 2: Efficiency Analyzer** - Identifies inefficiencies and optimization opportunities
3. **Agent 3: Cost Simulator** - Runs cost simulations and projections
4. **Agent 4: Terraform Generator** - Generates Terraform configurations
5. **Agent 5: Safe Deployer** - Applies changes safely with validation
6. **Agent 6: Documentation Writer** - Creates and maintains documentation
7. **Agent 7: Monitor & Anomaly Detector** - Monitors logs and detects anomalies

## Key Innovation

Unlike traditional cloud automation tools that require predefined scripts, OrbitOps uses LLM agents that can:
- Understand cloud architecture through natural language
- Make intelligent decisions about infrastructure changes
- Generate and apply configurations dynamically
- Learn from patterns and optimize continuously
